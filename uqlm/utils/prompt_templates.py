        The response to be broken down into fact pieces.

        The prompt template for breaking down the response into fact pieces.
    """

    claim_breakdown_template = f"""
    Please breakdown the following passage into independent fact pieces. 

    Step 1: For each sentence, you should break it into several fact pieces. Each fact piece should only contain one single independent fact. Normally the format of a fact piece is "subject + verb + object". If the sentence does not contain a verb, you can use "be" as the verb.

    Step 2: Do this for all the sentences. Output each piece of fact in one single line starting with ###. Do not include other formatting. 

    Step 3: Each atomic fact should be self-contained. Do not use pronouns as the subject of a piece of fact, such as he, she, it, this that, use the original subject whenever possible.

    Here are some examples:

    Example 1:
    Michael Collins (born October 31, 1930) is a retired American astronaut and test pilot who was the Command Module Pilot for the Apollo 11 mission in 1969.
    ### Michael Collins was born on October 31, 1930.
