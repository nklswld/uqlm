2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd uqlm`
3. Create and activate a virtual environment (using `venv` or `conda`)
4. Install poetry (if you don't already have it): `pip install poetry`
5. Install uqlm with dev dependencies: `poetry install --with dev`
6. Install our pre-commit hooks to ensure code style compliance: `pre-commit install`

You're ready to develop!

## Style Guides

### Code Style

- We use [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) to lint and format our files.
- Our pre-commit hook will run Ruff linting and formatting when you commit.
- You can manually run Ruff at any time (see [Ruff usage](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff#usage)).

Please ensure your code is properly formatted and linted before committing.
